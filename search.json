We plan to use these data to investigate where, how, and how often UC contributors are contributing to small and large open source repos. This may happen in the second half of 2026."

    "text": "Advice for OSPOs\n\nThe most common challenges that emerged from our study were time and funding. As such, OSPOs should consider either directly funding open source development, or coming up with creative ways to “give back” time or money. Examples might include facilitating co-working groups, promoting AI tools for documentation, or providing support for external grant acquisition.\nWe encountered high demand for affordable, accessible, feature-rich computing environments. This suggests an opportunity for academic OSPOs to help secure the technical infrastructure needed for open source development.\nBecause the needs of students, faculty, and IT staff diverge significantly, OSPOs may consider partnering with other university teams and departments to extend their reach.\nOSPOs may encounter a tension between institutional priorities (e.g., cost savings, licensing compliance) and developer priorities (e.g., funding, maintenance). OSPOs can and should find a balance by building an open source culture, in which open source activities are not merely monitored or regulated, but also supported, celebrated, and rewarded."
