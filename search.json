Timeline TBD.\nThere is also an aspect of the survey that we barely discussed in the paper–we asked people to share their GitHub (GitLab, etc.) usernames with us (optionally and voluntarily). We plan to use these data to investigate where, how, and how often UC contributors are contributing to open source repos.\nIf you are interested in collaborating with us on these projects or something else, please reach out to ospo@library.ucsb.edu."

    "text": "Takeaways for other OSPOs\n\nThe most common challenges that emerged from our study were time and funding. As such, OSPOs should explore creative force multipliers—such as facilitating co-working groups, integrating AI tools for documentation, or providing administrative support for external grant acquisition—as well as directly funding open source, if possible.\nA standout finding is the universal demand for high-quality computing environments, suggesting a specific infrastructure niche for academic OSPOs that differs from their industry counterparts.\nBecause the needs of students, faculty, and IT staff diverge significantly, OSPOs may consider partnering with other university teams and departments to extend their reach.\nOSPOs may encounter a tension between university administrative priorities (e.g., cost savings, licensing compliance) and developer priorities (e.g., funding and resources). OSPOs can and should find a balance, ideally one that demonstrates that all OSPO activity, even initiatives whose impacts may be indirect, is about supporting open source contributors and enacting open source values."
