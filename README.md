This repository is now archived and defunct. This was my attempt at a standalone
website for the 2025 UC Open Source Survey. Ultimately I decided to just put a
page on the UC OSPO Network website instead.

It may still be useful (mainly to me) in the future as an example of a simple
quarto website.

Here is the URL to the (defunct) website:
